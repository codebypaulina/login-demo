# Express Basics: Fake Login

- Create a new Express app named login-demo. Create a Git repository for it and push it to GitHub. We recommend you keep it separate from your regular challenges repository.
- The app should allow the user to log in, but since we are not working with state or databases yet, it will only demonstrate the basic functionality, and won't be a complete solution.
- It should have a Login page, a Home page, an Error page, and a My Account page.

## Routes

### 1. GET /

- Shows a simple web page, welcoming the user. Please add basic style with CSS. Please don't add React; just a simple static HTML page is fine.
- HINT: To deliver a CSS file, you either need to create a dedicated GET route (e.g. "/css/styles.css") or you can use the express.static() middleware to serve static files.
- The page should have a link to log in, which takes the user to /login

### 2. GET /echo/:message

- A simple route which echoes the message sent by the user
- eg. if the user goes to /echo/hello, the route should respond with 'hello'
- BUT if the user asks for /echo/secret, the route should respond with 'the secret is... 42!'

### 3. GET /login

- Shows the user a login page
- The page includes a header and a form
- The form includes inputs for email and password, and a submit button
- The form should be sent as a POST request to /login
- If the server responds with success: true, redirect to the My Account page
- If the server responds with success: false, redirect to the Error page

### 4. POST /login

- Should receive a request to log in.
- Validation: checks the body for email and password fields.
- If any of these are missing or empty, respond with JSON {"success": false}
- If the email and password are not empty, check if they match user@email.com and very-secret. If they do, respond with JSON: {"success": true}
- If they don't, respond with JSON {"success": false}

### 5. GET /my-account

- A simple dummy page
- Pretend it contains the user's actual account settings

### 6. GET /error

- A simple error page
- Should display a message linke "Something went wrong with your request" or similar.
